                <h2>About David McKinney</h2>
                <p>I've always had a passion for building things—whether it's businesses, teams, or even music. My real introduction to music and sound engineering came from my dad and from Jimmy Seals of Seals and Crofts, along with his kids. Those early experiences shaped my love for creativity and problem-solving, something that's carried into every part of my career.</p>
                
                <p>For over two decades, I've been in the trenches of business leadership and strategic growth, working with startups like Prolexic and Zenedge and leading at Oracle. I've helped leaders and organizations scale, adapt, and unlock their full potential—not just with strategies, but with real, hands-on execution.</p>
                
                <p>Life doesn't slow down much these days. With five kids, I've mastered the art of balancing responsibilities (or at least trying to). When I do carve out time for myself, you'll probably find me running (I finished my first full marathon last year), surfing, or playing basketball.</p>
                
                <p>At the end of the day, my mission is simple: help leaders cut through the noise, make bold moves, and build something lasting.</p>
